A playful, modern theme designed for business geodirectories and chambers of commerce.

== Description ==
Jeremy is designed to integrate seamlessly with [Buddypress](https://buddypress.org/) and [Event Organiser](https://wordpress.org/plugins/event-organiser/) to create a robust business directory and calendar.

== Installation ==
1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Anticipate eagerly...
4. Click Activate to use your new theme.

== Google Maps ==
The member geodirectory and the Event Organiser venue maps require a Google Maps [JavaScript API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key). If you plan on using the profile maps as well, you will need to request an [Embed API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key) for the same project.
